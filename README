## PIXL ENGINE 0.0.1

This project is my hobby project, not gonna be a big open source project like godot.

This is supposed to be written in C, but I chose not to write it in C entirely.

This is just a project for my own game as well. it just felt stupid not to make it public
since it will be helpful as well for my portfolio :D*.

## Minimal Example

```cpp
#include "main/engine.h"        // <-- important include :D*

class DemoApp : public IAppLogic {

    void init() {
        // Initialize Game Objects
    }

    void tick(const f32& dt) {
        // (essentially an update function) dt <- delta time (fixed dt)
    }

    void render() {
        // Render shit
    }

    void cleanup() {
        // Cleanup shit
    }

};

int main() {

    DemoApp app;            // <-- create an app object
    Engine engine(app);     // <-- pass the app to the engine
    engine.start();         // <-- start the engine :D*

}
